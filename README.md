# Stuck in the Past

## Introduction

This is the code for the game project of Emory University IDS290R Interdisciplinary Sidecar Seminar: Learning Italian through Gamification

- This 2D Top-Down Pixel game is designed for Emory Italian 101's summer session and implemented by Unity. We integrated user-NPC interaction and designed mini-games for Italian Beginners to practice grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, etc.



## Game

Due to a preposterous supernatural event,  you are sent back in time to 15th-century Italy.  In order to return to the present day, you have to master Italian through interactive tasks such as: shooting some asteroids, matching words to images, and more!
